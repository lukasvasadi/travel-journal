Last week, I boarded a plane to Barcelona to visit a woman I'd met three months ago at a conference in Budapest. My flight was delayed because Donald Trump had been touring the UK and departed from the same airport, Stanstead, for a flight to Scotland. Despite the late arrival, Denise waited patiently to surprise me at the gate. But being in a hurry to find a taxi, I walked straight past her for the exit. An unexpected tug at my shirt caused me to stop and turn around.

D. and I taxied to her apartment, had a quick snack of bread and Nutella, and crashed. In the morning, we walked through the city to a café called Brunch and Cake, passing several famous, and ostentatious, Goudi buildings. The architecture was interesting, but not so much as the enthusiasm that sprung across D.'s face whenever pointing out a new landmark. She described each design as if she were a historian.

We shared a salmon salad, pumpkin burger, and health smoothies. Occasionally, I slipped pieces of bread to the squadron of pigeons amassing under the table. After breakfast, we slowly made our way to _el Arco de Triunfo_ and the nearby statue of Apollo presiding over a fountain. We continued to _el Parque de la Ciutadella_, stopped for a moment to inspect a large elephant statue, and found a stretch of grass to nap.

Walking through _el Barrio Gótico_—the gothic section—we found the harbor and encountered hundreds of vendors lining the shore, selling knockoff designer purses, jewelry, Bohemian blankets, and much more. Past the vendors was an old restaurant called 1881 that boasted an unobstructed view of the bay.

I was not dressed for such a date. My tank top and shorts clashed with the formality of the waiter, who presented us with an entire cart of freshly caught fish. We declined the fish, but not the sangria, and ordered two servings of shrimp paella. After dinner, we brought our wine glasses out to the patio to watch the sun set over the bay full of yachts and dinghies.

I made pancakes the next morning while D. packed for the trip. We ate on the slanted rooftop of her apartment, overlooking the neighborhood with a web of clothes lines spread across the buildings. With the small five-speed rental car, we drove east to the ocean, then turned a sharp left north. Our first stop was the _Tossa del Mar_, a small costal municipality with a castle that sat on a hill over the shore.

Upon climbing the hill, we discovered a hidden network of walkways and shops. We entered one of the cafés and sat outside under a canopy of grape vines. There was no rush, no plan, no one else waiting for us, no commitment of any kind. We sat for two hours eating and drinking sangria. D. was familiar with the variety of Spanish tapas and translated each dish—pa amb tomaquet, tortilla de patatas, patatas bravas amb salsa romesco, anxovas amb oli d'oliva—between bites.

D. had planned for us to camp the first night. The campgrounds she had researched, _Camping Pola_, were tucked away in a small lagoon. Once she realized our situation, the woman at the registration desk recommended a campsite that was more private. The site, an area of sand that spanned about 10 ft in diameter, was nestled in a hill and concealed from our neighbors by short trees. With minutes of daylight to spare, we erected the tent and snacked on crackers with peanut butter.

With the sunrise, we wandered out to the shore and climbed some trails that belonged to the coastal route, or _Cami de Ronda_, that spans hundreds of miles along the cliffs and cloves that line the Mediterranean. At one point it started to rain and combined with the steepness of the cliffs, we started to slip along the trail. D. reached out for support, I grabbed her hand, and just when she lifted her foot, I released some of the tension. She slipped backward, but I caught her before she fell. When she found stable ground, she smacked my upper arm.

Finding shelter in the car, we drove to _Pals_, a medieval town with Greek and Roman influences. We aimlessly wandered around the ancient buildings and, while trying to find Russian baths, stumbled upon the _Platja Golfet_. This small coastal town had a small beach concealed in an alcove. Off in the distance, we saw people climb a rock formation that jutted from the water, about 50 yards from the shoreline, and then jump into the water.

D. and I swam out in the cold water to the formation, climbed its wet walls, and stood peering over the ledge. Others began to climb up behind us, but D. was timid at first. I jumped into the air, plunged down below the surface, and returned to find a strange sea creature—what appeared to be a red anemone—attached to the rock just above the water level. The water splashed several feet away and, moments later, D. appeared beside me. I poked the critter and, when it retracted, we both decided to return closer to shore.

The beach was partly shaded from the cliffs. Several older women tanned topless. Couples were spread across the sand on beach towels. We collected our belongings and left the beach for a short walk along the _Cami de Ronda_ before driving to the hotel at the next town. My only memory of the hotel is heat, as there was no air conditioning, and the veggie pizza we ordered from a small place down the road.

The following day, we drove to a nearby natural park, _Aiguamolls de l'Emporda_, that, in some areas, resembled an open zoo, with monkeys jumping between treetops and wild horses running around unrestricted. D. and I hiked along the trails to the beach. Along the way, I started to tease her for being prude, in jest, contrasting her swimwear with that of the older women from the previous day. After all, I explained, there was no law that women had to wear tops. D. tried to protest, unconvincingly, saying that she had no issue being exposed, embarrassment concealed in her voice.

We drove that evening to another coastal town, _Cadaques_, that was filled with shops and restaurants interspersed among narrow streets perched on an incline. I barely managed to squeeze the car through tight junctions and, in one section, Greek pillars that lined the road. The food was unremarkable, we agreed, but our table sat on the edge of the sea. D. and I sat on the same side of the table and peered out at the boats mooring in the bay.

Prior to dinner, we had stopped at another town, _Selva de Mar_, to check into the hotel called Fonda Felip. The small town was just as one would expect when imagining a Spanish country village: uneven stone roads, white two-story buildings with tan roofs, and several people with vespas, as all cars had to park in a grass lot outside the village entrance. The hotel was eclectic and had a private garden for the residents.

D. and the hostess started a conversation in Spanish while I peered aimlessly at the decorations. At one point, I caught the hostess turning to examine me with a look of suspicion and quiet speculation. When D. and I returned that night, it was too dark to appreciate the garden, but morning brought fresh light into the rooms. I almost lost D. wandering around the aisles of plants.

From the hotel, we drove south back to Barcelona, returned the car, and walked to the apartment building. Across the street was an indoor farmers market, where we bought some salmon from an old woman who filleted the fish with two expert motions of her knife. That evening we cooked the fish, poured sangria, and sat outside on the slanted roof watching Barcelona reveal itself before us.
