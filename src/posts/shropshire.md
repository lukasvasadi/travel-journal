title: Returning to England
description: As we walked across Cambridge, stopping at old familiar sights, I relived many memories and realized that I had changed as much, if not more, than the city.

## Kensington, London

My flight landed in Heathrow on a sunny Friday morning. As I exited the airport, tired from the red-eye, I boarded the Piccadilly line to Paddington, where I found a souvenir shop that offered luggage storage for £5 per bag per day. I deposited my bags and wandered through the streets to a nearby cafe, where I ordered a full English breakfast and sat next to a British-American couple.

After breakfast I meandered over to nearby Hyde Park and walked through the pathways till I reached a large field. Dogs were roaming everywhere off-leash, periodically reconnecting with their owners. I sat down beneath the shade of a tree and fell asleep. Thirty minutes later, I felt the sun shining on my face as the shade had retreated toward the base of the tree.
